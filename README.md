# Generative-AI-for-Fraud-Detection-and-Compliance
Functional prototype that demonstrate how to leverage GenAI in real-world application

# Objective
This project apply the concepts developing a generative AI-powered fraud detection system:
-  create synthetic data
-  train a model
-   integrate it into a simple compliance workflow.

# Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data
Tool: GenAI tool

Task: Generate a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world financial transactions. The dataset should include fields like transaction mamount, location, time, and a fraud flag.

Output: Save this dataset as a CSV file, which will be used for training
your AI model.

# Step 2: Train a Fraud Detection Model
Tool: Python with Scikit learn

Task: Use the synthetic dataset to train a generative AI model that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. 

Output: A trained model that can classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

# Step 3: Integrate the Model into a Compliance Workflow
Tool: Python 

Task: Develop a simple script that integrates your fraud detection model into a compliance workflow. The workflow should:
- Automatically check each transaction against the model’s predictions.
- Flag transactions that are deemed suspicious.
- Generate a report summarizing flagged transactions and any actions taken.

Output: A trained model that can classify transactions as either fraudulent or
legitimate.

# Step 4: Test and Optimize the System
Tool: Jupyter Notebook

Task: Test your model on a separate set of synthetic or real data (if available) to evaluate its accuracy and performance.
- Adjust model parameters to reduce false positives and false negatives.
- Optimize the workflow script for speed and efficiency.

Output: An optimized fraud detection system with documentation detailing
your testing process and results.

# Step 5: Document Your Process and Findings
Tool: MacOS Pages Jupyter Notebook

Task: Create a detailed report that includes:
- An overview of your approach and tools used.
- A description of the dataset and how it was generated.
- Steps taken during the model training and integration.
- Performance metrics and any challenges you faced.
- Potential improvements or next steps.
- 
Output: A comprehensive report.
